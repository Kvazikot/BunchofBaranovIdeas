# The idea of ​​brain organoids.
Over the past decade, the science of studying the brain has advanced quite a lot.
We have managed to make a complete map of the C elegans worm.
Although the plans were much more serious. Initially, the idea was to map the brain of a rat and, moreover, to simulate it in real life.
time on an ordinary Turing machine aka supercomputer.
The idea of ​​organoids is that we strengthen the biological organism by connecting it to the Internet
, but not directly, but by connecting to one of the organoids. Specially grown mini-brains consisting of the host's DNA
and possibly other compatible inserts. The Homo sapiens brain is too large and complex to be able to make a direct interface.
It is much easier to connect to a mini-brain that is grown somewhere else in the body, such as in the stomach, if the person is fat enough.
Before this operation, it is necessary to make sure that there is no high-level consciousness in the mini-brain.
Otherwise, a number of unpleasant ethical problems will arise.
Scientific production problem to solve the problems of mass production, cities, infrastructure, overcoming human extinction.
Each problem has its own unique mini brain
They must be compatible and interchangeable and work like Lego bricks as universal computer components. Be robust to radiation and memory confibulations
